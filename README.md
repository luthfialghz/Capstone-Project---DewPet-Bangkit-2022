# Mobile Development (Android)

## Introduction

We created a mobile application to detect pet diseases early using AI (Augmented Intelligence). This allows pet users/owners to detect diseases their pets are suffering from early and can find out the category of the disease. We also provide a feature to contact the doctor and make a meeting request by determining the schedule and description of the problems that the pet is suffering from. In addition, we also feature a nearby PetCare and PetShop detection feature which is intended if the pet is sick while traveling

The main function of the mobile application that we created is to assist the user/pet owner in detecting the disease suffered by the pet early and knowing the category of the disease. We are also developing features for buying and selling pet needs.
